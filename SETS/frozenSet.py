# <----------Frozenset---------->

# frozenset is an immutable version of a set.
# Like sets, it contains unique, unordered, unchangeable elements.
# Unlike sets, elements cannot be added or removed from a frozenset.

x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
y = x.copy()
print(y)
# print(type(x))
